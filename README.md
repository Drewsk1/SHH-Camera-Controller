To use this program, first open Silent Hill: Homecoming. Once in-game click the attach button. After successfully attaching to the process, the inject button will be enabled. After clicking the inject button, you will have full control of the camera. The camera's movement is controlled with the W,A,S,D,F,Space keys. The camera's rotation can be controlled with the arrow keys if the option is enabled. The keys are set up to be toggled. Once injected those keys will not be able to be used outside the game until you click the uninject button. Uninjecting will also return the camera to normal.
